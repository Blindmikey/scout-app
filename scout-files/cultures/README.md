##Scout-App Cultures & Translations

The source of truth for Scout-App translations is this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16FtHGThz0-CBz_rf_9QO4zOV7oNmNk2BlwmtvKuzAhs/edit?usp=sharing).

If you would like to translate Scout-App, edit that file and create an Issue on github informing us of the change.

By translating the app you get to pick what image is displayed for that language. It should be something culturally significant to native speakers.
