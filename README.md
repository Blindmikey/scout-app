# Scout-App 0.7.1 - *Classic*

<p align="center"><img src="http://scout-app.io/classic/images/thumb.jpg" alt="screenshot of the app"></p>

This is the source code to the 2012 version of Scout-App.

The website for the classic version can be seen here:

The 2012 version of Scout-App relies on Java 6 or 7 to run, and Adobe Air.

The knowledge of how to set up a dev environment to build new versions using this technology has been lost. As such, it is very unlikely that a new version will be made based directly off of the code in this branch.

However, a new version was created using different technology and can be seen at [Scout-App.io](http://scout-app.io)

The source code for the *latest* version is available in the [master branch](https://github.com/scout-app/scout-app/tree/master).
